1:
All the data in this directory is stored in a yaml file, this is found on the top of the existing file. In configfile: config.yaml.
This has a key: value structure and all the elements can be requested and processed. Same goes for the working directory configuration:
Using this structure gives clean and readable code. No datapaths need to be modified when cloned, just a config file needs to be made.

2:
There are not many in-line comments, but the output of the pipeline has a lot of comments. There are many things like (...).done or "plotting summary"
This is a nice way to do it, since the user knows exactly what is running and where possible errors can occur.

3:
there is an SQL password in the code
What i would improve is the readability of the code, there are almost no comments. Only the database function has comments, not what is going in or out
and the code is running. This could be improved.
